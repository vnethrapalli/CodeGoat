# CodeGoat

This is the `Segmentation Cult`'s code translation project for CS490. This application will allow you to translate your code from one programming language to another programming language, and is powered by GPT-3 for the translation and code checking.


Here is what our project's basic file structure looks like.

This project uses the [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) framework, which includes [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) for the frontend, [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) as a component library, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for our API, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) for our backend, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and SQL for our database, [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.

Redwood sets up the project with an `api` folder for the backend and the `web` folder for the frontend. In the `web` folder, all the React components and their Storybook stories are stored. The `api` folder contains the Prisma schema, backend services, and files related to authentication.

## Our Application

### Getting Started

Once opening the website, you will find yourself on our landing page, which provides some general information about our application. You can visit our _Documentation_ page to see visual guides for how to use the platform, as well as answers to common questions about our service.

Before the code translation service can be used, you must create an account and ensure that you are logged in. For new users, click on the signup button on the top right of the navbar at the top and follow the indicated steps. Returning users can log in via the login button also at the right side of the navbar.

### Using our Service

Once logged in, you can access our code translation service! To get started, click the Translate button at the top to access the _Translate_ page. Choose the desired input and target language using the language dropdown menu. You will see a codebox to input your code to be translated. Type your code there, or upload your code file if you already have some code handy.

Once you are ready, hit the Translate button at the bottom of the page and watch your translated code appear in the output code box on the right! How did we do? Let us know using the feedback feature now available below the translate button. Choose the desired number of stars, and click on the button.

All of your translation history will be available for you to see if you click on your user icon in the top right of the screen, and then clicking "Translation History". This will take you to the _History_ page. This will include the input and output languagues, the input code and its corresponding output code, the rating you provided (if one was provided), the date and time of the translation, and the API response (ie. 200 OK, etc). This page will also contain statistics regarding your usage such as the number of translations and the most frequently used language pair.

### More Feedback

By clicking the "Feedback" text in the navbar, you will be taken to our _Feedback_ page. Here you will see various criteria by which you can provide a 1-10 rating of our system. We appreciate your feedback, so please do take a look at this! There is a text box if you want to leave us a comment.
